# ev3-controller using asio

Download last stable [ASIO](http://think-async.com/Asio/Download) and
place it in `~/libraries/asio`.  This is needed for networking.  CMake
files assume that the `include` directory is located at
`~/libraries/asio/include`.


Install `libprotobuf-dev` and `protobuf-compiler` from the package manager.
